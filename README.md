## Project Overview

P2P File Sharing Service is a simple yet powerful peer-to-peer file sharing server written in Go, using only the standard library. The goal of the project is to create a distributed file sharing system where each node can act as both a client and a server, allowing users to securely and efficiently exchange files within a local network or over the Internet without relying on a central server.

## Project Idea

The main idea of the project is to create an easily scalable and secure P2P network that enables users to:
- Automatically discover other nodes in the local network using UDP broadcast.
- Directly exchange files over TCP connections, providing fast and easy access to data.
- Act as both a client (to request and send files) and a server (to receive files).

### Why Go?

Go was chosen as the development language due to its built-in support for networking operations, simplicity in handling concurrency (goroutines), and ease of building high-performance network applications. Using Goâ€™s standard library ensures minimal dependencies and a straightforward installation process.
